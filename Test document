# Introduction: How software is transforming educational expertise

On August 20, 2011, Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley entrepreneur, creator of the first widely adopted web browser Mosaic, and venture capitalist extraordinaire, published an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled "Why Software is Eating the World."  "Six decades into the computer revolution," the op-ed announced, "four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale."  The result, he argued, would be a complete reorganization of a variety of industries due to "lower start-up costs and a vastly expanded market for online services."
